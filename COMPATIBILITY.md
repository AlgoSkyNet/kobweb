# Compatibility

This page lists the versions of Compose and Kotlin that each version of Kobweb is built against.

| Kobweb  | Compose | Kotlin |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0.10.0+ | 1.2.0   | 1.7.10 |
| 0.9.12+ | 1.1.1   | 1.6.10 |
| 0.9.11- | 1.0.0   | 1.6.10 |

You should consider keeping these versions in sync in your own projects if possible to avoid unexpected
issues around diverging APIs.
