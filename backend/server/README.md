A webserver which understands and serves files generated by a Kobweb app.

Although the server is in some ways opaque to the Kobweb app developer, there will be ways to extend its behavior with
custom extensions.

## Debugging a running server

It can help to connect to a running server's stdout / stderr channels to get insights into what is going wrong.

To do this, use

```bash
# stdout = channel 1, stderr = channel 2
sudo cat /proc/$pid/fd/$channel
```

So for example, if your server is running with PID=12345, then run `sudo cat /proc/12345/fd/1`.
