The Kotlin/JS standard library occasionally feels incomplete, like it's missing utility methods that are common to want
even if they aren't part of the official JS APIs. This module will be a home for any such feature.

Note that in some cases, we will reimplement some classes you could technically have gotten from the official
"kotlin-wrappers" project, but Compose HTML does not play well with that project, so this duplication of effort may be
the next best solution.
