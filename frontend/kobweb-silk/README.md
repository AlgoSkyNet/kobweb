An opinionated UI-layer built on top of Kobweb.

**Note**: Many widgets are actually separated out into their own library (`kobweb-silk-widgets`), but this is an
implementation detail that most Kobweb users don't have to worry about. It's only useful to know if you want to use
Silk without Kobweb.

This library is inspired by the likes of Chakra UI and Material UI, for example.
