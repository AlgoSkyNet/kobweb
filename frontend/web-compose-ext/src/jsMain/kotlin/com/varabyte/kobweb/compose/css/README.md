NOTE: For the eagle-eyed among you, you may notice that the CSS definitions in this project intentionally skip adding
an enumeration for the "revert-layer" keyword. This is becomes, at the moment, Compose for Web (and, by extension,
Kobweb) does not have support for [Cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers).
Therefore, there currently isn't any reason to expose a value that users could never really make use of anyway.
