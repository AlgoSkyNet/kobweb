Compose HTML occasionally feels incomplete, especially with CSS properties. This module will act as a home
for any feature I feel is (temporarily) missing from the core library, with the hopes that they will be replaced with
upstream versions over time.

The `com.varabyte.kobweb.compose` package should conceptually map to `org.jetbrains.compose.web`.
