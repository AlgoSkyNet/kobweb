Kobweb is an opinionated Kotlin framework for building websites and web apps, inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

**It is currently in technology preview**. While it is not ready for use in a serious project at this point, please
consider starring the project to indicate interest. (See also: The
[work in progress](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb#work-in-progress) section below).

Our goal is to provide:

* an intuitive structure for organizing your Kotlin website or web app
* automatic handling of routing between pages
* a collection of useful _batteries included_ widgets built on top of Web Compose
* an environment built from the ground up around live reloading
* static site exports for improved SEO
* out-of-the-box Markdown support
* an open source foundation that the community can extend
* and much, much more!

Here's a demo where we create a Web Compose website from scratch with Markdown support and live reloading, in under 10
seconds:

# Trying it out yourself

## Build the Kobweb binary

**Note:** Building Kobweb requires JDK11 or newer. If you don't already have this set up, the easiest way is to
[download a JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html), unzip it somewhere,
and update your `JAVA_HOME` variable to point at it.

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdks/corretto-11.0.12
# ... or whatever version or path you chose
```

Once the code stabilizes a bit, we will host an artifact for downloading, but it's easy enough to build your own for
now.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb
$ cd kobweb
$ ./gradlew :cli:kobweb:installDist
```

I recommend putting Kobweb in your path:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/src/root/kobweb/cli/kobweb/build/install/kobweb/bin
$ kobweb version
```

## Create your Kobweb Site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/root
$ kobweb create site
```

You'll be asked a bunch of questions required for setting up your project. When finished, you'll have a basic project
with three pages - a home page, an about page, and a markdown page - and some components (which are collections of
reusable, composable pieces). Your own directory structure should look something like:

```
my-project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jsMain
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kotlin
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ org
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
        ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PageLayout.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sections
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NavHeader.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyApp.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AboutPage.kt
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Index.kt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ markdown
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Markdown.md

```

Note that there's no index.html or routing logic anywhere! We generate that for you automatically when you run Kobweb.
Which brings us to the next section...

## Run your Kobweb site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/root/your-project
$ kobweb run
```

This command spins up a webserver at http://localhost:8080. If you want to configure the port, you can do so by editing
your project's `.kobweb/conf.yaml` file.

You can open your project in IntelliJ and start editing it. While Kobweb is running, it will detect changes, recompile,
and deploy updates to your site automatically.

# Basics

Kobweb, at its core, is a handful of classes responsible for trimming away much of the boilerplate around building a
Web Compose app, such as routing and setting up default CSS styles. It exposes a handful of annotations and utility
methods which your app can use to communicate intent with the framework. These annotations work in conjunction with our
Gradle plugin (`com.varabyte.kobweb.application`) that handles code and resource generation for you.

Kobweb is also a CLI binary of the same name which provides commands to handle the parts of building a Web Compose app
that are less glamorous. We want to get that stuff out of the way, so you can enjoy focusing on the more interesting
work!

## Create a page

Creating a page is easy! It's just a normal `@Composable` method. To upgrade your composable to a page, all you need to
do is:

1. Define your composable in a file somewhere under the `pages` package
1. Annotate it with `@Page`

Just from that, Kobweb will create a site entry for you automatically.

For example, if I create the following file:

```kotlin
// com/example/mysite/pages/admin/SettingsPage.kt

@Page
@Composable
fun SettingsPage() {
    /* ... */
}
```

this will create a page that I can then visit by going to `mysite.com/admin/settings`.

By default, the path comes from the file name (with the suffix `Page` removed, if present), although there will be ways
to override this behavior on a case-by-case basis (* *coming soon*).

The file name `Index.kt` is special. If a page is defined inside such a file, it will be treated as the default page
under that URL. For example, a page defined in `.../pages/admin/Index.kt` will be visited if the user visits
`mysite.com/admin`.

## Silk

Silk is a UI layer included with Kobweb and built upon Web Compose. (To learn more about Web Compose, please visit
[the official tutorials](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Web/Getting_Started)).

While Web Compose requires you to understand underlying html / css concepts, Silk attempts to abstract a lot of that away,
providing an API more akin to what you might experience developing a Compose app on Android or Desktop. Less
"div, span, flexbox, attrs, styles, classes" and more "Rows, Columns, Boxes, and Modifiers".

We consider Silk a pretty important part of the Kobweb experience, but it's worth pointing out that it's designed as an
optional component. You can absolutely use Kobweb without Silk. You can also interleave Silk and Web Compose without
issue (as Silk, itself, is just composing Web Compose methods).

## Components: Layouts, Sections, and Widgets

Outside of pages, it is common to create reusable composable parts. While Kobweb doesn't enforce any particular rule
here, we recommend a convention which, if followed, may make it easier to allow new readers of your codebase to get
around. 

First, as a sibling to pages, create a folder called **components**. Within it, add:

* **layouts** - High-level composables that provide entire page layouts. Most (all?) of your `@Page` pages will start 
  by calling a page layout function first. You may only have a single layout for your entire site.
* **sections** - Medium-level composables that represent compound areas inside your pages, organizing a collection of
  many children composables. If you have multiple layouts, it's likely sections would be shared across them. For
  example, nav headers and footers are great candidates for this subfolder. 
* **widgets** - Low-level composables. Focused UI pieces that you may want to re-use all around your site. For example,
  a stylized visitor counter would be a good candidate for this subfolder. 

# Work in progress

Current ETA to MVP: Mid-November 2021 (or even sooner ü§û)

The following items are on our radar but not yet done:

* `kobweb export` - Generate a static version of your site
  * and add `kobweb run --env prod` which can serve that static site
* Dynamic routes - Allow people to visit `mysite.com/blog/1234` which gets redirected to some page registered at
  `pages/blog/{id}` with "1234" passed in as a parameter.
* API routes - Serverless functions which you can define (and annotate, like `@Page`s), which will get triggered when the
  user visits an associated URL (like `mysite.com/api/hello`)
* Breakpoints - An intuitive way to have Silk composables behave differently based on the size of the page (inspired
  by [Chakra UI's feature of the same name](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/responsive-styles). 
* The Silk API is still undergoing late-stage design and needs to be finalized and polished
* Persistence APIs (or at least guidance using existing Web Compose APIs)
* An example website using Kobweb

# Templates

Kobweb provides its templates in a separate git repository, which is referenced within this project as a submodule for
convenience. To pull down everything, run:

```bash
/path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb

# or, if you've already previously cloned kobweb...
/path/to/src/root/kobweb
$ git submodule update --init
```

# Filing issues and leaving feedback

It is still early days, and while we believe we've proven the feasibility of this approach at this point, there's still
plenty of work to do to get to a 1.0 launch! We are hungry for the community's feedback, so please don't hesitate to:

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/issues)
* Contact us (using any of the ways mentioned above) telling us what features you want
* Ask us for guidance, especially as there are no tutorials yet (your questions can help us know what to write first!)

And, finally, please considering starring the project to indicate interest. We are trying to understand if this is
something that the community wants, and your support in this way would mean a lot to us as well as encourage us to keep
moving forward.
