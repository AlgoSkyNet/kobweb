Kobweb is an opinionated Kotlin framework for building websites and web apps, inspired by Next.js and Chakra UI. 

**It is currently in technology preview**. While it is not ready for use in a serious project at this point, please
consider starring the project to indicate interest. (See also: The
[work in progress](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb#work-in-progress--known-issues) section below).

Our goal is to provide:

* an intuitive structure for organizing your Kotlin website or web app
* automatic handling of routing between pages
* a collection of useful _batteries included_ widgets built on top of Web Compose
* an environment built from the ground up around live reloading
* static site exports for improved SEO
* out-of-the-box Markdown support
* an open source foundation that the community can extend
* and much, much more!

Here's a demo where we create a Web Compose website from scratch with Markdown support and live reloading, in under 10
seconds:

# Trying it out yourself

## Build the Kobweb binary

**Note:** Building Kobweb requires JDK11 or newer. If you don't already have this set up, the easiest way is to
[download a JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html), unzip it somewhere,
and update your JAVA_HOME variable to point at it.

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdks/corretto-11.0.12
# ... or whatever version or path you chose
```

Once the code stabilizes a bit, we will host an artifact for downloading, but it's easy enough to build your own for
now.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb
$ cd kobweb
$ ./gradlew :cli:kobweb:installDist
```

I recommend putting Kobweb in your path:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/src/root/kobweb/cli/kobweb/build/install/kobweb/bin
$ kobweb version
```

## Create your Kobweb Site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/root
$ kobweb create site
```

You'll be asked a bunch of questions required for setting up the project. When finished, you'll have a basic project
with three pages - a home page, an about page, and a markdown page - and some components (which are collections of
reusable, composable pieces). Your own directory structure should look something like:

```
my-project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jsMain
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kotlin
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ org
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
        ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PageLayout.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sections
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NavHeader.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyApp.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AboutPage.kt
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Index.kt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ markdown
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Markdown.md

```

Note that there's no index.html or routing logic anywhere! We generate that for you automatically when you run Kobweb.
Which brings us to the next section...

## Run your Kobweb site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/root/your-project
$ kobweb run
```

This spins up a webserver at http://localhost:8080. If you want to configure the port, you can do so by editing your
project's `.kobweb/conf.yaml` file.

You can open your project in IntelliJ and start editing it. While Kobweb is running, it will detect changes and deploy
updates to your site automatically.

## Layered upon Web Compose

While Kobweb includes its own UI layer (called Silk), you can also use Web Compose methods as well. To learn more about
Web Compose, please visit [the official tutorials](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Web/Getting_Started).

# Basics

Kobweb, at its core, is a handful of classes responsible for trimming away much of the boilerplate around building a
Web Compose website - namely routing and setting up default CSS styles - plus exposing a handful of annotations and
utility methods to further help with this. These work in conjunction with our Gradle plugin
(`com.varabyte.kobweb.application`) that handles code and resource generation for you.

Kobweb is also a CLI binary of the same name which helps users execute commands to handle the parts of building a
Web Compose app that are less glamorous. We want to get that stuff out of the way, so you can enjoy working on the more
interesting parts!

## Create a page

Creating a page is easy! It's just a normal `@Composable` method with just a small bit of runtime magic. To upgrade your
composable to a page, all you need to do is:

1. Define your composable somewhere under the `pages` package
1. Annotate it with `@Page`

From that, Kobweb will create a site entry for you automatically.

For example, if I create the following file:

```kotlin
// com/example/mysite/pages/settings/AdminPage.kt

@Page
@Composable
fun AdminPage() {
    /* ... */
}
```

this will create a page that I can then visit by going to `mysite.com/settings/admin`. By default, the path comes
from the file name (with the suffix `Page` removed, if present), although there will be ways to override this behavior
on a case-by-case basis (* *coming soon*).

The file name `Index.kt` is special. If a page is defined inside such a file, it will be visited when the user visits
the URL without specifying the path's child, so `.../pages/settings/Index.kt` will be visited if the user visits
`mysite.com/settings`.

## Silk

Silk is a UI layer built on top of Kobweb and Web Compose. While Web Compose forces you to understand underlying
html / css , Silk attempts to abstract a lot of that away, providing a UI more akin to what you might experience
developing a Compose app on Android or Desktop. Less "div, span, and flexbox" and more "Rows, Columns, and Boxes" in
other words.

We consider Silk a pretty important part of the Kobweb experience, but it's worth pointing out that it's designed as an
optional component. You can absolutely use Kobweb without Silk. You can also interleave Silk and Web Compose without
issue (as Silk, itself, is just composing Web Compose methods).

## Components: Layouts, Sections, and Widgets

Outside of pages, it is common to create reusable composable parts. While Kobweb doesn't enforce any particular rule
here, we recommend a convention which, if followed, may make it easier to allow new readers of your codebase to get
around. 

First, create a root folder called **components**. Within it, add:

* **layouts** - High-level composables that provide reusable page layouts. Most (all?) of your `@Page` pages will start 
  by calling a page layout function immediately. 
* **sections** - Medium-level composables that represent areas inside your pages, themselves delegating to many children
  composables. If you have multiple layouts, it's likely that would share these sections. Nav headers and footers are
  great candidates for this subfolder. 
* **widgets** - Low-level composables. One-off pieces that are extremely flexible to re-use all around your site. A
  visitor counter component would be a good candidate for this subfolder. 

# Work in progress / known issues

The following items are on our radar but not yet done:

* Markdown + Silk integrations are fragile
* `kobweb export` - Generate a static version of your site
  * and add `kobweb run --env prod` which can serve that static site
* Dynamic routes - Allow people to visit `mysite.com/blog/1234` which gets redirected to some page with "1234" passed in
  as a parameter.
* API routes - Functions you can define, like pages, which will get triggered when the user visits an associated URL
  (like `mysite.com/api/hello`)
* Breakpoints - An intuitive way to have Silk composables behave differently based on the size of the page (inspired
  by [Chakra UI's feature of the same name](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/responsive-styles). 

They are coming! Thank you for your patience.

# Templates

Kobweb provides its templates in a separate git repository, which is referenced within this project as a submodule for
convenience. To pull down everything, run:

```bash
/path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb

# or, if you've already previously cloned kobweb...
/path/to/src/root/kobweb
$ git submodule update --init
```
