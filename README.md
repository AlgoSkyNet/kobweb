# Küï∏Ô∏èbweb

Kobweb is an opinionated Kotlin framework for creating websites and web apps, built on top of
[Web Compose](https://compose-web.ui.pages.jetbrains.team) and inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

```kotlin
@Page
@Composable
fun HomePage() {
  Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
    Row(Modifier.align(Alignment.End)) {
      var colorMode by rememberColorMode()
      Button(
        onClick = { colorMode = colorMode.opposite() },
        Modifier.clip(Circle())
      ) {
        Box(Modifier.margin(4.px)) {
          // Includes support for Font Awesome icons
          if (colorMode.isLight()) FaSun() else FaMoon()
        }
      }
    }
    H1 {
      Text("Welcome to Kobweb!")
    }
    Row {
      Text("Create rich, dynamic web apps with ease, leveraging ")
      Link("https://kotlinlang.org/", "Kotlin")
      Text(" and ")
      Link("https://compose-web.ui.pages.jetbrains.team/", "Web Compose")
    }
  }
}
```

**Kobweb is currently in technology preview**. Please consider starring the project to indicate interest, so we know
we're creating something the community wants. [How ready is it? ‚ñº](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb#can-we-kobweb-yet)

Our goal is to provide:

* an intuitive structure for organizing your Kotlin website or web app
* automatic handling of routing between pages
* a collection of useful _batteries included_ widgets built on top of Web Compose
* an environment built from the ground up around live reloading
* static site exports for improved SEO
* shared, rich types between client and server
* out-of-the-box Markdown support
* an open source foundation that the community can extend
* and much, much more!

Here's a demo where we create a Web Compose website from scratch with Markdown support and live reloading, in under 10
seconds:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43705986/135570277-2d67033a-f647-4b04-aac0-88f8992145ef.mp4

# Trying it out yourself

The first step is to get the Kobweb binary. You can download it or build it, so we'll include instructions for both
approaches.

## Download the Kobweb binary

Our binary artifact is hosted on github. To download latest:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/applications/kobweb
$ wget https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/releases/download/v0.7.3/kobweb-0.7.3.zip
$ unzip kobweb-0.7.3.zip
```

and I recommend adding it to your path, either directly:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/applications/kobweb/kobweb-0.7.3/bin
$ kobweb version # to check it's working
```

or via symbolic link:

```base
$ cd /path/to/bin # some folder you've created that's in your PATH
$ ln -s /path/to/applications/kobweb/kobweb-0.7.3/bin/kobweb kobweb
```

## Build the Kobweb binary

Although we host Kobweb artifacts on github, it's easy enough to build your own.

**Note:** Building Kobweb requires JDK11 or newer. If you don't already have this set up, the easiest way is to
[download a JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html), unzip it somewhere,
and update your `JAVA_HOME` variable to point at it.

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdks/corretto-11.0.12
# ... or whatever version or path you chose
```

With `JAVA_HOME` set up, building is just a single Gradle command:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb
$ cd kobweb
$ ./gradlew :cli:kobweb:installDist
```

Finally, update your PATH:

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/path/to/src/root/kobweb/cli/kobweb/build/install/kobweb/bin
$ kobweb version # to check it's working
```

## Create your Kobweb site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/
$ kobweb create site
```

You'll be asked a few questions required for setting up your project.

You don't need to create a root folder for your project ahead of time - the setup process will prompt you for one to
create.

When finished, you'll have a basic project with three pages - a home page, an about page, and a markdown page - and some
components (which are collections of reusable, composable pieces). Your own directory structure should look something
like:

```
my-project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jsMain
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kotlin
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ org
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
        ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PageLayout.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sections
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NavHeader.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets
        ‚îÇ               ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GoHomeLink.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyApp.kt
        ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ About.kt
        ‚îÇ                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Index.kt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ markdown
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Markdown.md

```

Note that there's no index.html or routing logic anywhere! We generate that for you automatically when you run Kobweb.
Which brings us to the next section...

## Run your Kobweb site

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projects/root/your-project
$ kobweb run
```

This command spins up a webserver at http://localhost:8080. If you want to configure the port, you can do so by editing
your project's `.kobweb/conf.yaml` file.

You can open your project in IntelliJ and start editing it. While Kobweb is running, it will detect changes, recompile,
and deploy updates to your site automatically.

## Examples

Kobweb will provide a growing collection of samples for you to learn from. To see what's available, run:

```bash
$ kobweb list

You can create the following Kobweb projects by typing `kobweb create ...`

‚Ä¢ examples/todo: An example TODO app, showcasing client / server interactions
‚Ä¢ site: A template for a minimal site that demonstrates the basic features of Kobweb
```

For example, `kobweb create examples/todo` will instantiate a TODO app locally.

# Basics

Kobweb, at its core, is a handful of classes responsible for trimming away much of the boilerplate around building a Web
Compose app, such as routing and setting up default CSS styles. It exposes a handful of annotations and utility methods
which your app can use to communicate intent with the framework. These annotations work in conjunction with our Gradle
plugin (`com.varabyte.kobweb.application`) that handles code and resource generation for you.

Kobweb is also a CLI binary of the same name which provides commands to handle the parts of building a Web Compose app
that are less glamorous. We want to get that stuff out of the way, so you can enjoy focusing on the more interesting
work!

## Create a page

Creating a page is easy! It's just a normal `@Composable` method. To upgrade your composable to a page, all you need to
do is:

1. Define your composable in a file somewhere under the `pages` package in your `jsMain` source directory.
1. Annotate it with `@Page`

Just from that, Kobweb will create a site entry for you automatically.

For example, if I create the following file:

```kotlin
// jsMain/kotlin/com/example/mysite/pages/admin/Settings.kt

@Page
@Composable
fun SettingsPage() {
    /* ... */
}
```

this will create a page that I can then visit by going to `mysite.com/admin/settings`.

By default, the path comes from the file name, although there will be ways to override this behavior on a case-by-case
basis (* *coming soon*).

The file name `Index.kt` is special. If a page is defined inside such a file, it will be treated as the default page
under that URL. For example, a page defined in `.../pages/admin/Index.kt` will be visited if the user visits
`mysite.com/admin`.

## Silk

Silk is a UI layer included with Kobweb and built upon Web Compose. (To learn more about Web Compose, please visit
[the official tutorials](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Web/Getting_Started)).

While Web Compose requires you to understand underlying html / css concepts, Silk attempts to abstract a lot of that
away, providing an API more akin to what you might experience developing a Compose app on Android or Desktop. Less
"div, span, flexbox, attrs, styles, classes" and more "Rows, Columns, Boxes, and Modifiers".

We consider Silk a pretty important part of the Kobweb experience, but it's worth pointing out that it's designed as an
optional component. You can absolutely use Kobweb without Silk. You can also interleave Silk and Web Compose without
issue (as Silk, itself, is just composing Web Compose methods).

### Inline vs StyleSheet

Before continuing, for those new to the web, it's worth understanding that there are two ways to set styles on your HTML
elements: inline and stylesheet.

Inline styles are defined on the element tag itself, and in raw HTML might look like:

```html
<div style="background-color:black">
```

Meanwhile, any given html page can reference a list of stylesheets which can define a bunch of styles, where each style
is tied to a selector (which _selects_ what elements those styles apply to).

A concrete example stylesheet can help here:

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
  color: magenta
}
#title {
  color: yellow
}
```

And you could use that stylesheet to style the following document:

```html
<body>
  <!-- Div get background-color from "body" and foreground color from "#title" -->
  <div id="title">
      Yellow on green
  </div>
</body>
```

There's no hard and fast rule, but in general, when writing html / css by hand, stylesheets are often preferred over
inline styles as it better maintains a separation of concerns. That is, the html should represent the content of your
site, while the css controls the look and feel.

Of course, sometimes, you need to define the style of a single, specific element only. You can do that by giving it an
ID and then targeting it via an ID selector in your stylesheet (like "#title" in the example above), or you can just
set inline styles on it, which may be far easier.

We're not writing html / css by hand, however -- we're using Web Compose! So the distinctions discussed up until now are
less important here.

However, there are times when you have to use stylesheets, because without them you can't define styles for advanced
behaviors (particularly [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes),
[pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), and
[media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), the discussion of
which are outside the scope of this README). So in those cases, it's good to understand that there's an occasional
and fundamental difference.

In general, when you pass styles defined on the fly into a composable widget in Silk, those will result in inline
styles, whereas if you use `ComponentStyle` to define the styles, that will get embedded into the site's stylesheet.
We'll talk more about these approaches in the following sections.

```kotlin
// Uses inline styles
Box(Modifier.color(Colors.Red)) { ... }

// Uses a stylesheet
val MyBoxStyle = ComponentStyle("my-box") {
    base { Modifier.Color(Colors.Red) }
}
Box(MyBoxStyle.toModifier())
```

One last note: debugging your page with browser tools may be easier if you lean on stylesheets over inline styles,
because it makes your DOM tree easier to look through without all that extra noise.

### Modifier

Silk introduces the `Modifier` class, in order to provide an experience similar to what you find in Jetpack Compose.
In the world of Web Compose, you can think of a `Modifier` as a layer on top of CSS styles. So this:

```kotlin
Modifier.background(Colors.Red).color(Colors.Green).padding(200.px)
```

if passed into a widget composable, like `Box`:

```kotlin
Box(Modifier.background(Colors.Red).color(Colors.Green).padding(200.px)) {
    Text("Green on red")
}
```

would generate an HTML tag with a style property like: `<div style="background:red;color:green;padding:200px">`

#### attrModifier and styleModifier

There are a bunch of modifier extensions (and they're growing) provided by Kobweb, like `background`, `color`, and
`padding` above. But there are also two escape hatches into web compose anytime you run into something that's missing:
`attrModifier` and `styleModifier`.

Using them looks like this:

```kotlin
// Modify attributes of an element tag
// e.g. the "a", "b", and "c" in <tag a="..." b="..." c="..." />
Modifier.attrModifier {
    onMouseDown { /* ... */ }
}

// Modify styles of an element tag
// e.g. the "a", "b", and "c" in `<tag style="a:...;b:...;c:..." />
Modifier.styleModifier {
    width(100.percent)
    height(50.percent)
}

// Note: Because "style" itself is an attribute, you can define styles in an attrModifier:
Modifier.attrModifier {
    style {
        width(100.percent)
        height(50.percent)
    }
}
// ... but in the above case, you should use a styleModifier for simplicity
```

### ComponentStyle

With Silk, you can define a style like so, using the `base` block:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.backgroud(Colors.Red)
    }
}
```

and convert it to a modifier by using `CustomStyle.toModifier()`. At this point, you can pass it into any composable
which takes a `Modifier` parameter:

```kotlin
// Approach #1 (uses inline styles)
Box(Modifier.background(Colors.Red)) { /* ... */ }

// Appraoch #2 (uses stylesheets)
Box(CustomStyle.toModifier()) { /* ... */}
```

#### Additional states

So, what's up with the `base` block?

You can additionally define various other styles that take effect conditionally. The base style will always apply first,
but then additional styles can be applied based on what state the element is in. (If multiple states are applicable at
the same time, they will be applied in the order specified.)

Here, we create a style which is red by default, but green when the mouse hovers over it:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.color(Colors.Red)
    }

    hover {
        Modifier.color(Colors.Green)
    }
}
```

Kobweb provides a bunch of these state blocks for you for convenience, but for those who are CSS-savvy, you can always
define the CSS rule directly to enable more complex combinations or reference states that Kobweb hasn't added yet.

For example, this is identical to the above style definition:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.color(Colors.Red)
    }

    cssRule(":hover") {
        Modifier.color(Colors.Green)
    }
}
```

#### Breakpoints

There's a feature in the world of responsive html / css design called breakpoints, which confusingly have nothing to do
with debugging breakpoints, but rather specifying size boundaries where styles change. This is how sites often present
content differently on mobile vs. tablet vs. desktop.

Kobweb provides five breakpoints for your use, named after sizes: "sm", "md", "lg", "xl". They are initialized with
reasonable values, but you can override them if you want to decide what they mean for your app.

By default, it can be useful to think of:

* no breakpoint - mobile (more specifically, the style will appear the same on mobile as any other device)
* sm - tablets (and larger)
* md - desktops (and larger)
* lg - widescreen (and larger)
* xl - ultra widescreen

You can change the default values by adding an "init silk" block to your code:

```kotlin
@InitSilk
fun initializeBreakpoints(ctx: InitSilkContext) {
    ctx.config.registerBreakpoints(
        BreakpointSizes(
            sm = ...,
            md = ...,
            lg = ...,
        )
    )
}
```

Despite the flexible potential of multiple sizes, many projects will be able to get away just using base styles and occasional
"md" styles.

To reference a breakpoint in a `ComponentStyle`, just invoke it:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.fontSize(24.px)
    }

    Breakpoint.MD {
        Modifier.fontSize(32.px)
    }
}
```

#### Color-mode aware

When you define a `ComponentStyle`, an optional field is available for you to use called `colorMode`:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.color(if (colorMode.isLight()) Colors.Red else Colors.Pink)
    }
}
```

Note that Silk provides a `SilkTheme` object you can reference in styles. For example, if you want to set your element's
color to match the color that we use for links, you can reference the `SilkTheme.palettes[colorMode]` object to do so:

```kotlin
val CustomStyle = ComponentStyle("custom") {
    base {
        Modifier.color(SilkTheme.palettes[colorMode].link.default)
    }
}
```

`SilkTheme` contains very simple (e.g. black and white) defaults, but you can override them in an "init silk" method,
perhaps to something that is more brand aware:

```kotlin
@InitSilk
fun overrideSilkTheme(ctx: InitSilkContext) {
    ctx.theme.palettes = SilkTheme.palettes.copy(
        light = SilkTheme.palettes.light.copy(
            /* Specify light colors to override */
        ),
        dark = SilkTheme.palettes.light.copy(
            /* Specify dark colors to override */
        )
    )
}
```

#### ComponentVariant

With a style, you can also create a variant of that style (that is, additional modifications that are always applied
_after_ the base style is). Here's an example:

```kotlin
val CustomVariant = CustomStyle.addVariant("example-variant") {
    base {
        Modifier.background(Colors.Green)
    }
}
```

Variants can be particularly useful if you're defining a custom widget that has default styles, but you want to give
callers an easy way to deviate from it in special cases.

For example, maybe you define a button widget (perhaps you're not happy with the one provided by Silk):

```kotlin
val ButtonStyle = ComponentStyle("my-button") { /* ... */ }

// Note: Creates a style called "my-button-outline"
val OutlineButtonVariant = ButtonStyle.addVariant("outline") { /* ... */ }

// Note: Creates a style called "my-button-invert"
val InvertButtonVariant = ButtonStyle.addVariant("invert") { /* ... */ }
```

This wasn't mentioned earlier, but you can pass variants into the `ComponentStyle.toModifier(...)` method. If done, it
will apply both of them.

***Note:** Using a variant that was created from a different style will have no effect. We tried to use generics as a
fancy way to enforce this at compile time but ran into limitations with the Compose compiler (see
[Web Comopse bug #1333](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/issues/1333)). We may revisit this API design later if resolved.*

So bringing it all together, you should write code that looks something like this:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Button(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    variant: ComponentVariant? = null,
    @Composable content: () -> Unit
) {
    val finalModifier = ButtonStyle.toModifier(variant).then(modifier)
    Box(finalModifier, content)
}
```

In other words, apply the modifiers in order of base style, then variant, then finally user overrides.

A caller might call your widget one of several ways:

```kotlin
// Approach #1: Use default styling
Button { /* ... */ }

// Approach #1: Tweak default styles with a button variant
Button(variant = OutlineButtonVariant) { /* ... */ }

// Approach #3: Tweak default styles with a inline styles
Button(Modifier.background(Colors.Blue)) { /* ... */ }
```

### Font Awesome

Kobweb provides the `kobweb-silk-icons-fa` artifact which you can use in your project if you want access to all the free
Font Awesome icons.

Using it is easy! Search the [Font Awesome gallery](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free), choose an
icon, and then call it using the associated Font Awesome icon composable.

For example, if I wanted to add the Kobweb-themed
[spider icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/spider?style=solid), what I could do is call this in my Kobweb code:

```kotlin
FaSpider()
```

That's it!

Some icons have a choice between solid and outline versions, such as "Square"
([outline](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/square?style=regular) and
[filled](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/square?style=solid)). In that case, the default choice will be outline mode,
but you can pass in a style enum to control this:

```kotlin
FaSquare(style = IconStyle.FILLED)
```

All Font Awesome composables accept a modifier parameter, so you can tweak it further:

```kotlin
FaSpider(Modifier.color(Colors.Red))
```

***Note**: When you create a project using our `site` template, Font Awesome icons are included.*

## Components: Layouts, Sections, and Widgets

Outside of pages, it is common to create reusable, composable parts. While Kobweb doesn't enforce any particular rule
here, we recommend a convention which, if followed, may make it easier to allow new readers of your codebase to get
around.

First, as a sibling to pages, create a folder called **components**. Within it, add:

* **layouts** - High-level composables that provide entire page layouts. Most (all?) of your `@Page` pages will start by
  calling a page layout function first. You may only have a single layout for your entire site.
* **sections** - Medium-level composables that represent compound areas inside your pages, organizing a collection of
  many children composables. If you have multiple layouts, it's likely sections would be shared across them. For
  example, nav headers and footers are great candidates for this subfolder.
* **widgets** - Low-level composables. Focused UI pieces that you may want to re-use all around your site. For example,
  a stylized visitor counter would be a good candidate for this subfolder.

## Define API routes

You can define and annotate methods which will generate server endpoints you can interact with. To add one:

1. Define your method (optionally `suspend`able) in a file somewhere under the `api` package your `jvmMain` source
   directory.
1. The method should take exactly one argument, an `ApiContext`.
1. Annotate it with `@Api`

For example, here's a simple method that echoes back an argument passed into it:

```kotlin
// jvmMain/kotlin/com/example/mysite/api/Echo.kt

@Api
fun echo(ctx: ApiContext) {
    // ctx.req is for the incoming request, ctx.res for responding back to the client

    // Queries are parsed from the URL, e.g. here "/echo?message=..."
    val msg = ctx.req.query["message"] ?: ""
    ctx.res.setBodyText(msg)

    // You could also do something like: `ctx.res.body = ctx.req.body`
    // but using query parameters makes for an easier demo
}
```

After running your project, you can test the endpoint by visiting `mysite.com/api/echo?message=hello`

You can also trigger the endpoint in your frontend code by using the extension `api` property added to the
`kotlinx.browser.window` class:

```kotlin
@Page
@Composable
fun ApiDemoPage() {
  val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()

  Button(onClick = {
    coroutineScope.launch {
      println("Echoed: " + window.api.get("echo?message=hello")!!.decodeToString())
    }
  })
}
```

All the HTTP methods are supported (`post`, `put`, etc.). Of course, you can also use `window.fetch(...)` directly.

## Markdown

If you create a markdown file under the `jsMain/resources/markdown` folder, a corresponding page will be created for you
at build time, using the filename as its path.

For example, if I create the following file:

```markdown
// jsMain/resources/markdown/docs/tutorial/Kobweb.kt

# Kobweb Tutorial

...
```

this will create a page that I can then visit by going to `mysite.com/docs/tutorial/kobweb`

The power of Kotlin + Web Compose is composable interactive components though, not static text! That's why Kobweb
Markdown support enables extensions to allow this out of the box.

### Front Matter

Front Matter is metadata that you can specify at the beginning of your document, like so:

```markdown
---
title: Tutorial
author: bitspittle
---
```

and these key / value pairs can be referenced in your Kotlin `@Composable` code (* *coming soon*).

However, there's a special value which, if set, will be used to render a root `@Composable` that wraps the code your
markdown file would otherwise create. This is useful for specifying a layout for example:

```markdown
---
root: .components.layout.DocsLayout
---

# Kobweb Tutorial
```

This will generate code like the following:

```kotlin
import com.mysite.components.layout.DocsLayout

@Composable
@Page
fun KobwebPage() {
    DocsLayout {
        H1 {
            Text("Kobweb Tutorial")
        }
    }
}
```

### Kobweb Call

A markdown extension built just for Kobweb, you can surround a path to a `@Composable` method with double-curly braces
to call it:

```markdown
# Kobweb Tutorial

...

{{ .components.widgets.VisitorCounter }}
```

which will generate code for you like the following:

```kotlin
import com.mysite.components.widgets.VisitorCounter

@Composable
@Page
fun KobwebPage() {
    /* ... */
    VisitorCounter()
}
```

In this way, you can write pages that are mostly static text punctuated with beautiful, interactive components. This
could be a great approach for people who want to write and host their own blogs, for example.

## Version Catalogs

The project templates created by Kobweb all embrace Gradle version catalogs, which are (at the time of writing this
README) a relatively new feature, so users may not be aware of it.

There is a file called `libs.versions.toml` that exists inside your project's root `gradle` folder. If you find yourself
wanting to tweak or add new versions to projects you originally created via `kobweb create`, that's where you'll find
them.

For example, here's the
[libs.versions.toml](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb-site/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml) we use for our own
landing site.

To read more about the feature, please check out the
[official docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:conventional-dependencies-toml).

# Can We Kobweb Yet

Current state: **Functional but early**

Kobweb has some pretty big pieces working already. It is easy to set up a new project and get things running quickly.
The live reloading flow is pretty nice, and you'll miss it when you switch to projects that don't have it. It supports
generating pages from Markdown that can reference your Composable code. And while it's not quite server-side rendering,
you can export static pages which will get hydrated on load.

However, there's still a lot to do. The API surface is a bit lean in some areas right now, especially around Silk UI
components, plus filling in holes in the APIs that interact with Web Compose. There are probably quite a few sharp
corners. And while the code is decently documented, higher level documentation is missing. Windows support needs love.

So, should you use Kobweb at this point? If you are...

* a Kotlin tinkerer who is excited to play around with new tech and isn't afraid of creating toy projects atop APIs
  which may shift underfoot:
    * **YES!!!** Please see the [connecting with us ‚ñº](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb#connecting-with-us) section
      below, we'd definitely love to hear from you. Now's a great time if you'd want to have a voice in the direction of
      this project.
* a Kotlin developer who wants to write a small web app or create a new blog from scratch:
    * ***Maybe***, but now is probably a bit too early. It's getting close!
* someone who already has an existing project in progress and wants to integrate Kobweb into it:
    * **No**
* a company:
    * **NOOOOOO** (someday, we hope, but not yet)

# Advanced

## Templates

Kobweb provides its templates in a separate git repository, which is referenced within this project as a submodule for
convenience. To pull down everything, run:

```bash
/path/to/src/root
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb

# or, if you've already previously cloned kobweb...
/path/to/src/root/kobweb
$ git submodule update --init
```

## What about Multiplatform Widgets?

Jetbrains is working on an experimental project called "multiplatform widgets" which is supposed to bring the Desktop /
Android API to the web. And it may seem like the Kobweb + Silk approach is competing with it.

However, I've found there is a fundamental distance between Desktop / Android Compose and Web Compose. Specifically,
Desktop / Android targets render to their own surface, while Web modifies a parallel html / css DOM tree and leaves it
to do the final rendering.

This has major implications on how similar the two APIs can get. For example, in Desktop / Android, the order you apply
modifiers matters, while in Web, this action simply sets html style properties under the hood, where order does not
matter.

One approach would be to own the entire rendering pipeline, ditching html / css entirely and targeting a full page
canvas or something. However, this limits the ability for robots to crawl and index your site, which is a major
drawback. It also means that debugging in a browser would be a rough experience, as the browser's developer tools would
be limited in the insights it could provide for your site. It would also prevent a developer from making use of the rich
ecosystem of Javascript libraries out there that modify the DOM tree themselves.

For now, I am making a bet that the best way forward is to embrace the web, sticking to html / css, but providing a rich
UI library of widgets that hopefully makes it relatively rare for the developer to worry about it. For example, flexbox
is a very powerful component, but you'll find it's much easier to compose Rows and Columns together than trying to
remember if you should be justifying your items or aligning your content, even if Rows and Columns are just creating the
correct html / css for you behind the scenes anyways.

# Known Issues

* `kobweb run` sometimes gets stuck when Gradle (running behind it) gets stuck.
    * Quit kobweb, run `./gradlew --stop`, and then try again
    * Run `./gradlew kobwebGen` or `./gradlew kobwebStart` with various Gradle debug options to see what's going on
      under the hood (e.g. `./gradlew kobwebStart --stacktrace`)

# Filing issues and leaving feedback

It is still early days, and while we believe we've proven the feasibility of this approach at this point, there's still
plenty of work to do to get to a 1.0 launch! We are hungry for the community's feedback, so please don't hesitate to:

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/issues/new/choose)
* Contact us (using any of the ways mentioned above) telling us what features you want
* Ask us for guidance, especially as there are no tutorials yet (your questions can help us know what to write first!)

Thank you for your support and interest in Kobweb!
